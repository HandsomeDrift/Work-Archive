1. When citing references, it would be helpful to emphasize key studies to showcase the foundation of the current research and highlight its differences from existing work. By doing so, the paper can better illustrate how it builds upon or diverges from previous methods and frameworks, positioning the contribution within the broader context of the field.

## Related Works

1. 在最后部分提及的IRC可以简要说明其机制和预期的影响，以增强对BMIRC框架的理解。
2. 在提到图像和文本的集成时，可以具体说明为何这些方法不适用于ECG，例如缺乏足够的标注数据或不同的特征分布，以体现本文方法的优势所在。在总结现有研究的不足时，可以更多地强调为什么选择掩蔽数据建模对ECG分类特别重要，以及与其他方法相比的优势。



1. In the final section where IRC is mentioned, it would be helpful to briefly explain its mechanism and expected impact to enhance the understanding of the BMIRC framework. A concise explanation of how IRC works, along with its contribution to the overall model performance, will provide readers with a clearer picture of its role within the framework.

2. When discussing the integration of image and text modalities, it would be beneficial to specifically explain why these methods are not applicable to ECG data, such as the lack of sufficient labeled data or differences in feature distribution. This would highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. Furthermore, when summarizing the limitations of existing studies, it would be valuable to emphasize why masked data modeling is particularly important for ECG classification and how it offers advantages over other approaches. By focusing on these points, the paper can more clearly demonstrate the rationale behind the choice of methodology and its superiority in the context of ECG data analysis.

## Experiment

1. 作者清楚地描述了使用的数据集，但可以进一步详细说明数据集的质量，例如各数据集的采样标准，记录方式，噪声程度等。此外，是否有数据清理、排除标准（如排除异常心电图）也可以进一步说明。这些补充信息有助于评审人了解数据集的质量和多样性，这对模型的泛化能力评估至关重要。
2. 对于数据预处理部分，虽然描述了降噪、下采样和归一化等步骤，但可以进一步解释这些步骤对模型性能的影响，尤其是不同滤波方法的选择（如Butterworth滤波器）以及其在不同数据集上的效果差异。更多的实验数据可以说明这些预处理步骤是如何优化模型性能的，有助于增强方法的说服力。
3. 针对心电图数据中的多标签分类问题，作者提到了标签重构，但对不平衡数据处理的方法描述较为简略。建议补充说明如何具体实现平衡策略（如欠采样、过采样、代价敏感学习等），并对其效果做对比实验。心电图分类任务的标签通常有不均衡的情况，详细说明处理方法能够帮助其他研究者更好地复现结果，也能让审稿人更清楚你所采取的方法是否足够合理和有效。
4. 在实验结果中，建议引入统计检验方法（例如t检验、显著性分析），以确保实验结果具有统计显著性，而不是由于随机性因素导致的差异。**原因**：统计显著性分析能够增强结果的可信度，特别是在不同方法之间差异不大的情况下，显著性检验能够更清晰地说明模型的优劣。
5. 建议对实验结果的讨论进一步扩展，特别是针对不同对比方法下的表现差异，是否有可能是由于某些特定数据集特性（如噪声、类别不平衡）或模型架构特性（如transformer block数量等）导致的？你可以讨论一些实验结果背后的潜在原因。通过深入分析实验结果中的细节，可以增强实验部分的理论深度，也有助于评审人和读者理解模型的实际表现和局限性。
6. 作者提到所有实验都在RTX 2080-Ti GPU上运行，但没有提供模型的训练时长、资源消耗等信息。建议补充说明不同模型在同一硬件下的训练时间以及计算效率。对比不同方法的计算效率可以为审稿人提供一个全面的参考，特别是在实际应用中，模型的计算成本也是重要的考量因素。
7. 作者列出了详细的超参数设置，但建议增加对超参数调优过程的描述，例如调优策略（网格搜索、随机搜索等）以及参数敏感性分析。超参数的设置对模型性能有显著影响，描述调优过程能够展示模型在不同超参数下的表现差异，增强结果的可信度。



1. The author clearly describes the datasets used, but further details on the quality of the datasets would be beneficial, such as the sampling criteria, recording methods, and noise levels in each dataset. Additionally, information on data cleaning and exclusion criteria (e.g., excluding abnormal ECGs) could be expanded upon. Providing this information will help reviewers better understand the quality and diversity of the datasets, which is critical for evaluating the generalization ability of the model.

2. In the data preprocessing section, while steps such as denoising, down-sampling, and normalization are mentioned, it would be helpful to elaborate on how these steps impact model performance, especially regarding the choice of different filtering methods (e.g., Butterworth filter) and their effectiveness across different datasets. Including more experimental data showing how these preprocessing steps optimize model performance would strengthen the persuasiveness of the method.

3. Regarding the multi-label classification problem in ECG data, the author mentions label reconstruction but provides limited details on handling class imbalance. It is recommended to elaborate on how balancing strategies (e.g., undersampling, oversampling, cost-sensitive learning) are implemented and include comparative experiments to demonstrate their effects. Class imbalance is common in ECG classification tasks, and detailing how it is addressed will help other researchers replicate the results and give reviewers a clearer understanding of the adequacy and effectiveness of the methods used.

4. In the experimental results, it is suggested to introduce statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests, significance analysis) to ensure that the results are statistically significant and not due to random factors. **Rationale**: Statistical significance analysis would enhance the credibility of the results, particularly when the differences between methods are small. Significance testing can clarify the superiority of the model.

5. It is recommended to further expand the discussion of the experimental results, particularly regarding the performance differences across different comparative methods. Could these differences be attributed to specific characteristics of the datasets (e.g., noise, class imbalance) or model architecture (e.g., the number of transformer blocks)? Discussing potential reasons behind the experimental outcomes can deepen the theoretical analysis of the experiments and help reviewers and readers understand the model's actual performance and limitations.

6. The author mentions that all experiments were conducted on an RTX 2080-Ti GPU but does not provide information on training time or resource consumption. It is recommended to include details about the training time and computational efficiency of different models on the same hardware. Comparing the computational efficiency of various methods will provide reviewers with a comprehensive reference, especially since computational cost is an important consideration in real-world applications.

7. The author provides a detailed hyperparameter configuration but should consider adding a description of the hyperparameter tuning process, such as the tuning strategy (e.g., grid search, random search) and parameter sensitivity analysis. Since hyperparameter settings can significantly affect model performance, describing the tuning process will showcase how the model performs under different configurations, thus enhancing the credibility of the results.

## Experiment Results

1. 虽然实验结果展示了多个表格中的具体数据，但对于结果的解释较为简略，缺乏足够的分析。建议在每个实验结果后，提供更多关于为什么某些模型或设置能够取得更好效果的推论。
2. 实验结果中多个表格展示了精度、AUPRC 等指标，建议在表格旁增加图形化的展示（如柱状图或折线图）来辅助理解。此外，可以在表格标题或脚注中更清晰地标注各个实验条件（如是否经过预训练、数据集大小等）。例如，表 1 和表 2 的结果之间差异是否仅源于预训练数据集大小，或者还有其他因素？
3. 在细化训练集比例实验部分，建议探讨不同训练集比例对模型泛化能力的影响。BMIRC 在 50% 数据集上的性能优于随机初始化的 100% 数据集训练结果，这一现象非常值得深入讨论。
4. 虽然 BMIRC 在大多数实验中表现优异，但在某些场景下仍表现出一定的局限性，例如在 Chapman 数据集上不如 TS-TCCR。在结论中，建议详细讨论这些局限性，以及模型可能的改进方向。
5. BMIRC 在心电图数据集上的表现令人印象深刻，但是否能够扩展到其他时间序列任务尚未明确。建议作者在实验部分或结论部分简要讨论 BMIRC 在其他时间序列任务（如语音信号、股市数据）中的潜在应用。



1. **Insufficient Analysis of Experimental Results**: Although the experimental results are presented with detailed data across multiple tables, the interpretation of these results is somewhat brief and lacks sufficient analysis. It is recommended to provide more thorough reasoning and hypotheses for why certain models or configurations achieve better results after each set of experimental results.
2. **Incorporate Graphical Representations**: The experimental results include precision, AUPRC, and other metrics across multiple tables. To enhance clarity, it is recommended to add graphical representations (e.g., bar charts or line graphs) alongside the tables. Furthermore, the table captions or footnotes could more clearly indicate the specific experimental conditions (e.g., pre-training status, dataset size). For example, is the difference between Table 1 and Table 2 results solely due to the size of the pre-training dataset, or are there other contributing factors?
3. **Impact of Training Set Proportions**: In the section on varying the training set proportions, it would be beneficial to further explore how different training set sizes impact the model’s generalization ability. The observation that BMIRC performs better on 50% of the dataset than a randomly initialized model trained on 100% of the dataset is particularly noteworthy and warrants a more detailed discussion.
4. **Limitations of BMIRC in Certain Scenarios**: While BMIRC outperforms other models in most experiments, it still exhibits limitations in certain scenarios, such as underperforming TS-TCCR on the Chapman dataset. It is recommended to elaborate on these limitations in the conclusion and discuss potential directions for improving the model.
5. **Potential Applications to Other Time Series Tasks**: BMIRC's performance on ECG datasets is impressive, but its ability to generalize to other time-series tasks is not explicitly discussed. The authors are encouraged to briefly discuss the potential applications of BMIRC to other time-series tasks, such as speech signals or stock market data, in either the experimental or conclusion sections.
